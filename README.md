## A5 test
#### description
Run your model on the test set using: \
  `sh run.sh test` \
and **report your test set BLEU score in your assignment write-up. Also ensure that
the output file outputs/test outputs.txt is present and unmodified { this will be
included in your submission, and we’ll use it to verify your self-reported BLEU score.**
Given your BLEU score b, here’s how your points will be determined for this sub-problem:

blue score | point  
-|-
0≤b<21|0
21≤b<22.5| 2
22.5≤ b|6

#### test result
A5 Decoding: 100% 8064/8064 [40:53<00:00,  3.52it/s]  
Corpus BLEU: 24.25344745890522
